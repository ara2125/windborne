# ðŸŽˆ Windborne Balloon & Hurricane Landfall Analysis

The objective of this project is to identify the relationship between weather balloons and historical hurricane landfall. With hurricanes becoming stronger and more frequent,
it has become even more important to identify key areas where hurricanes typically hit land and how strong these storms tend to be.

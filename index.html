  <h1>üéà Windborne Balloon Position & Hurricane Landfall Analysis</h1>

  <p>
    Climate change has gradually increased the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, such as hurricanes
    tropical storms. Thus, <strong>Windborne's weather balloons</strong> are crucial to predicting the conditions leading to the development
    and landfall of these hurricanes. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>NOAA's HURDAT2</strong> is a dataset that includes decades of hurricane and tropical storm landfall information.
    This ML project uses recent hurricane data and weather balloon position information to identify key relationships between
    the balloons' positions and the hurricane's conditions. The goal is to identify where <strong>weather balloons should be concentrated</strong>
    and whether there is a <strong>correlation between balloon position and hurricane wind speeds</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>üß™ Methodology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fetched each balloon's latitude, longitude, and altitude positions through Windborne's live constellation API.</li>
    <li>Filtered through NOAA's HURDAT2 dataset to include hurricanes from 2020 to 2023 for maximum relevancy.</li>
    <li>Matched balloon positions to hurricane positions based on proximity (1‚Äì7 degrees) to identify priority areas for weather balloon placement.</li>
    <li>Trained a Random Forest model to predict hurricane wind speed from balloon proximity and altitude</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìä Results</h2>
  <p>The analysis was repeated at various proximity thresholds. Below are the key findings:</p>

  <h3>Results at 3¬∞ Proximity</h3>

  <h3>Results at 5¬∞ Proximity</h3>

  <h3>Results at 7¬∞ Proximity</h3>
  <img src="results_7deg.png" alt="Results at 7 degrees" />

  <p>Across all thresholds, feature importance analysis revealed that <strong>altitude</strong> and <strong>distance</strong> both contribute meaningfully to the prediction of hurricane intensity.</p>
